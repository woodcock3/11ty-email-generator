Dear {Appointment_LetterRecipient}

Your civil partnership conversion appointment is booked for:  

Date: {Appointment_AppointmentDate}

{% include "partials/map-button.html" %}

Customer reference: {Appointment_Id}{Appointment_Office_EmailText}

Please arrive 10 minutes before your scheduled appointment; late arrival will mean that you will not be seen and your appointment will be rebooked.

## Do not forget
You must bring documents for each person attending the appointment.

We will need to see evidence of your:
- name (passport or driving licence)
- date of birth (passport or driving licence)
- address (driving licence, most recent bank statement, this years council tax bill or most recent utility bill)

We will also need to see your original civil partnership certificate.

Converting with an optional ceremony
============================
You can choose to delay the signing of the ‘conversion to marriage’ declaration and include this as part of a separate ceremony. If you would like a ceremony, this can be held at the Civic Hall or at any of our licensed venues. We will discuss this with you at your appointment. Visit [leeds.gov.uk](www.leeds.gov.uk/births-deaths-and-marriages/ceremonies/ceremonies-at-licensed-venues) for the contact details for each venue.
 
## Change or cancel
If you cannot attend your appointment, you can change or cancel it. This needs to be done at least two working days before your appointment. Your change or cancel code is: {Appointment_RescheduleCancelCode}
