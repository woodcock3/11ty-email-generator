Hi!

This is a test email with an image of Corgi's. The email templates are build using [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/woodcock3/lcc11-emails).

I hope this email template resource is helpful.

The original email template is built by [Stephanie Eckles](https://11ty.rocks/#email-generator) which I updated the npm packages and adapted for [Leeds City Council](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/) usage. For more information about this html email template please contact Paul in the register office.
